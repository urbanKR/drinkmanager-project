# Drink Manager App

This is a Drink Manager App - a full-stack application which I have built using Spring Boot and Angular. This project serves as an demonstration of creating a pretty simple, but strong web application with a potent backend and a nice frontend.

## Project Overview

The Drink Manager App is designed to help user manage his favorite drinks efficiently. Whether you're a beverage enthusiast, a connoisseur, or simply looking for a convenient way to keep track of your drink, this app has you covered.

### Features

- **API Creation**: I've built a pretty simple and comprehensive backend API using Spring Boot, which serves as the heart of the application. This API allows user to perform different operations like adding, editing, and deleting drinks.

- **Angular Frontend**: The frontend of this app is powered by Angular. It provides an intuitive user interface for interacting with the drink database.

- **Spring Data JPA**: My backend utilizes Spring Data JPA to interact with a MySQL database. This ensures efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **API Endpoints**: I've exposed a range of API endpoints that enable you to interact with the drink database over HTTP. This includes handling HTTP requests for adding, updating, and deleting drinks.

- **Angular Components**: The Angular frontend is built using components that enhance code modularity and reusability.

- **Angular Forms**: I've implemented Angular forms for seamless data entry and editing.

- **Angular Routing**: Navigate through the app effortlessly with Angular routing, ensuring a smooth user experience.

- **Angular Services**: Services in Angular are used for communication with the backend, making HTTP requests, and handling data.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Frontend Setup**: Navigate to the "frontend" directory and set up your Angular environment. You can do this by running the necessary commands, such as `npm install` to install dependencies and `ng serve` to start the development server.

3. **Backend Setup**: In the "backend" directory, you'll find the Spring Boot application. Make sure you have Java and Maven installed. You can run the application using `mvn spring-boot:run`.

4. **Database Configuration**: Configure the MySQL database settings as needed in the Spring Boot application properties.

5. **Start Using the App**: Access the app via your browser and start managing your drinks. Add new drinks, edit existing ones, and delete when necessary.

## Conclusion

The Drink Manager App for me was not just a project - it was more like a learning experience. By exploring this project I hope I have gained more insights into full-stack development, RESTful APIs, Angular and Spring Boot. Also I hope this can serve as a valuable resource.
